## Q-01 · Supplier logo files — OPEN, opened 2026-08-31 (W6-01)

Twelve brands are now named in the marquee: technonicol, bilka, novatik, iko,
swisspor, knauf, baumit, ceresit, weber, ytong, holcim, bosch.

**Needed:** one full-colour logo file per brand, dropped at
`public/img/suppliers/<slug>.svg` (preferred) or `.png`. Transparent background.
No second greyscale asset: the grey default state is a CSS filter.

**Default shipped:** a chip with no logo file renders the brand name as text in
the white tile. The fallback is per brand, so the first logo to land shows as a
logo while the other eleven stay text.

**Also needs a ruling:** are all twelve brands actually used by Rapid Construct?
The marquee is a public claim about suppliers. The names came from the card, not
from the site copy, so they are treated as the owner's input rather than
invented, but nobody has confirmed the list against the business.

## Q-02 · Projects per service — OPEN, opened 2026-08-31 (W6-02)

The card asks for 5 to 7 projects per service across 9 services (45 to 63).

**Default shipped:** 6 per service, 54 total. Mid-range, and it divides evenly.

## Q-03 · Gallery slots on stub projects — OPEN, opened 2026-08-31 (W6-02)

The manifest's project shape is 1 cover + 3 to 4 gallery photos. Applying it to
44 new stub projects would put 132 unshootable gallery slots into the shoot plan.

**Default shipped:** stub projects carry a cover slot only. Gallery slots are
added to a project when it has real content and real photographs, which is what
manifest rule D-6 already says ("a project with fewer than three usable gallery
photos ships as cover only"). The 10 existing projects keep their galleries.

Cost of the alternative, for comparison: 216 photo slots instead of 89.

## Q-04 · Real content for 44 stub projects — OPEN, opened 2026-08-31 (W6-02)

Every stub ships with empty fields and is invisible on the site: `build.js`
drops any project without a real title and summary. They become visible only
when someone fills them.

**Needed per project:** title, summary, and optionally location, year,
work_type, area_sqm, duration, main_materials, challenge. Nothing is invented.
